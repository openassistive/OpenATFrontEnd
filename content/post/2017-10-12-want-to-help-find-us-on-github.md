We really want YOUR help in developing the resources and structure of this site. If you want to contribute to the site development you will find two repositories on GitHub

[OpenATFrontEnd](https://github.com/openassistive/OpenATFrontEnd)  - The code that builds the frontend. This relies on Hugo and a custom theme (which can be found [here](https://github.com/openassistive/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme)). 

[OpenATBackend](https://github.com/openassistive/OpenATBackend) - The API code that is called when people Add new projects. Its all written in NodeJS. 

We welcome Pull Requests. Let us know if you have any problems.
