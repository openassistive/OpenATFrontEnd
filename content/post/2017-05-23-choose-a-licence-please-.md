Open source is [really](http://www.pcworld.com/article/209891/10_reasons_open_source_is_good_for_business.html) really important, [good ](https://oscedays.org/open-house-why-open-source-hardware-is-important-to-scientists/)and[ important for business](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2486991/app-development-4-reasons-companies-say-yes-to-open-source.html). (Remember: Open source doesn't really mean [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html)). For your repository to truly be open source, you'll need to license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software.

Please, so others can properly benefit from your work, please choose a license for your project. http://choosealicense.com/ can help. Thanks
