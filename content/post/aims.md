OpenAssistive is a collective of indviduals from AT Makers, Hackers, Private enterprising indviduals, Government funded organisations - all who are trying to break down the barriers of disability by providing open solutions for Assistive Technology. 

We aim to:

* Collaborate on discussion about the best way of collaborating! We know OpenAT isnt everything we want it to be. We can collectively make it better
* Share expertise, Good practice, share what works, share how to do this. We can do this better together rather than in indivual silos. 
* Create a open sustainable architecture where not one organisation "owns" data or direction. The aims are the group - not any one person or people.
