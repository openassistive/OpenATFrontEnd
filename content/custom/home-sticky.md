Open Assistive allows you to share and catalogue your own open assistive technology hardware and software projects, or find those of others. To find catalogued projects, either search above or <a href="/tags/">browse by tag</a>. To catalogue a project, keep it where you chose on GitHub, Instructables, Pinshape, Sourceforge, Thingiverse or Dropbox.  Then just paste your project url above and Open Assistive will catalogue your work. Simple!  <br/><br/> <div style="font-size: 80%;">(<a href="/help"> See Help to find out more about how Open Assistive works  </a>)</div>
