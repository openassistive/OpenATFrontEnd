OpenAssistive is a catalogue of Open Source Assistive technology solutions. You can [search](#search) for a project or look for a project under a [tag](/tags/) or if you want to add a new project simply add your GitHub, Instructables, Pinshape, Sourceforge or Thingiverse page of your project here (see the [add page](/add) for more details): 


<!-- SHORTENING TEXT FOR NOW
## What is Assistive Technology? 

Open Source Assistive Technology Software (OATS) combine the benfits of open development with accessibility. Open accessibiity tools and programs may be openly shared, modified or studied. They are free or low cost, and yet reliable as problems are rapidly fixed. With open accessibility, users, friends and support staff discuss what they would like with developers and other 'techies' to create the software that they want. Good accessibility ideas can be freely shared and built on. Open accessibility ensures that people with disabilities, including the elderly and children, can get the most from computers and ICT. 
	
## Why is this different to other similar projects?

1. The site is created by *you* 
2. We don't host anything. You host your project where you want (instructables, GitHub, Pinshape, Thingiverse or even dropbox (coming soon!)) and simply give us the basic details. You just then keep your site/code/files updated there and we will scrape your data periodically (or not - you just need to edit the data on the site)
3. The site is totally open. Want to do something else with the data? Go ahead. Want to do something better? Great! Worried about the database dying and this good will gesture going down hill rapidly? Don't (in short the site is hosted for free and there is no database)

## So you want to help?

Simply add your project URL by clicking on the add button in the menu on the right. We currently support:

* Github (e.g. http://github.com/user/projectname)
* Instructables (e.g. http://instructables.com/id/project-name)
* Pinshape (e.g. http://pinshape.com/items/project-id)
* Sourceforge (e.g. http://sourceforge.net/projects/project-name/)
* Thingiverse (e.g. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:id)

Alternatively you can host your own metadata

* Dropbox (COMING SOON!)
* Any http site (COMING SOON!)

## EEk! I have a problem

Great. Im sure we haven't found half the bugs yet! Drop us a line or if you want - fix it!
