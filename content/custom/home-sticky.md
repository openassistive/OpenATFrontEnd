Open Assistive allows you to share and catalogue your own open assistive technology <a href="/categories/hardware/">hardware </a> and <a href="/categories/software/">software</a> projects, or find those of others. To find catalogued projects, either search above or <a href="/tags/">browse all items by tag</a>. Want to make some AT software and need some help? Try <a href="https://openassistive.org/awesome-assistivetech">Awesome-Assistivetech</a>. 
<br />
To catalogue a project, keep it where you chose on GitHub, Instructables, Pinshape, Hackaday, Sourceforge, Thingiverse or <a href="/2017/04/how-to-add/edit-your-own-project-files-advanced/">Dropbox & elsewhere online</a>.  Then just paste your project url above (or <a href="/add/">add it here</a>) and Open Assistive will catalogue your work. Simple!
