Tablet PC Speech Assistant

 The Tablet PC Speech Assistant is a program which runs on the Tablet PC or the more portable Ultra-Mobile PC. The software was originally built by Todd Landstad, a software engineer with years of experience with Tablet PC development. He developed the Tablet PC Speech Assistant as an aid for people who have problems speaking. The Tablet PC Speech Assistant can make it fairly easy for some people to have phrases that they often use spoken by the default voice on the Tablet PC. Given that the software require fairly good handwriting ability, and access to specific hardware, it will not be practical for some people.

 Once you get familiar with the Tablet PC Speech Assistant, it can be quite simple to use. You can build up a sentence to be spoken, by selecting words or phrases from lists, and also handwriting to add extra words to the sentence. Not many people have used the Tablet PC Speech Assistant, but it has proved to be a useful tool in some cases. If you think that the software has the potential to be useful to you, let me know. I can change what it currently does if that might make it more useful to you.

 If after reading the details below, you'd like to try out the Tablet PC Speech Assistant, click <a class="" href="" style13=""> **How to install the Tablet PC Speech Assistant**</a>.

 **Important**: The Tablet PC Speech Assistant can require expensive hardware to run. For example, the pictures below show a small Tablet PC and an Ultra-mobile PC. Given that in practice the software and hardware might not be useful, I would not recommend that you consider purchasing the hardware to run the Tablet PC Speech Assistant until you've had a chance to try it out first. Neither picture shows external speakers attached. External speakers are probably required in order for the speech to be heard.
