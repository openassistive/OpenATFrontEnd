Plaphoons is one of the many valuable results from the Catalan Fressa project, made available under a CC-BY-NC-SA licence. It is a comprehensive tool for alternative access and AAC. Versions are available for MS Window (95 - 7), Java (GPL license) and recently for Android. Most information still only available in Catalan and Spanish.
