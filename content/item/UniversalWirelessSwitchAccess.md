Using a computer and especially a tablet without fingers is a challenge. Fortunaltely, most of the OS are equiped with accessibility tools designed to help users to access more easily their computer and tablet.

To further extend those possibility, it is possible to connect external switch to help, for example, with some screen scrolling to choose an item on the screen, to navigate and to select. 

In my quest to find the cheaper and smarter solutions to build this kind of external switch, I found that mixing a very cheap selfie button, found on Ebay, with my own design maybe will be a interesting solution. Tests on different OS are shown on this video : [UWSA tests](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yma1FJRDItg&feature=youtu.be)

Printed in ABS, no support, it is possible to play with density to change the hardeness of the switch.

Really interesting idea for a wireless switch. Wireless selfie switches are often cheap and have a long battery life. As the author notes in the project however please be cautious which project you use this until you test it out fully
