###   


### What is it like?

The object of the game is to name a sound or tune that is presented as a prompt. A typical round in _Name That Animal_ goes like this:

1. You hear ""Can you name this animal?""
2. Then an animal sound is played, for example a dog barking.
3. You use the _left_ or _right_ arrow keys on the keyboard to move through and hear the possible answers. In this case they might be ""Cat"", ""Dog"", ""Elephant"", and ""Horse"".
4. In some games, the _down_ arrow key will give a hint about the correct answer.
5. When you hear the correct answer, you press the _up_ arrow key to guess.
6. If the chosen answer is correct, you will hear a _reward_ sound which might be a crowd cheering, or a musical fan fare. If the answer is incorrect, you will hear ""Try again."".
7. The process then repeats playing another one of the sounds for the four animals.
8. When all the animals in the group have been played, the game begins another round with four more animals.

When **Hark The Sound** first starts it says ""Use the left or right arrow keys to choose a game to play."" Using the arrow keys you can move through and hear the choices for games (listed below). When you hear a game you want to play, use the _up_ arrow key to select it.

The _Escape_ key (often labeled **ESC** in the upper left corner of the keyboard) will quit the current game and return to the game selections.
