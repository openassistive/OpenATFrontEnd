description: "Dkey is disambiguation software for computers - it works in a similar way to \'predictive text\' on your mobile phone. It is designed to allow quicker text input for people with physical disabilities who can use a keyboard with a small number of keys, for example a number pad keyboard.  It can also be used with mouse input, or with switch input via other software.  It is designed with people with disabilities in mind, but could be used by anyone."
