Touchscreen devices have become a staple piece of technology in this day and age. In 2016, upwards of 1.6 billion people in the world are using smartphones. Most people cannot get through the day without using their smartphone. It keeps us connected. It keeps us organized. It is an integral part of our social lives. For people in wheelchairs whom experience difficulties with fine upper body motor control, the usage of mobile devices can be very challenging. Statistics show there are over 1 million people in the United States and Canada that have very limited or no use of their hands, making touchscreen devices very difficult or impossible to use.

The &quot;LipSync&quot; is an assistive technology device which is being developed to allow quadriplegics and other people with limited hand use the ability to use touchscreen mobile devices by manipulation of a mouth-operated joystick with integrated sip and puff controls. The user is able to manipulate a cursor on their device screen using a mouth-operated joystick with integrated sip and puff controls to simulate the actions of &quot;tap&quot; and hitting the back button, respectively. With longer sips and longer puffs, additional secondary features are enabled including a &quot;tap and drag&quot;, &quot;long tap and drag&quot; and the possibility of more specialized functions as per the user's needs. The LipSync is design specifically for portable devices, it does not require AC power, but it will work with any device including desktop and laptop computers that support mice through a universal serial bus (USB).
