This is a small system tray app designed in Python to interpret one or two key presses pressed in a set way (morse) and convert them to the key equivalent. This should mean that a user who has good timing can access the entire computer to write and control their machine - potentially with one or two keys or switches. Mouse implementation is flaky right now.

Currently built for Windows. Let us know how you get on with different variants of Windows. Plan is to port this to Mac at some point.
