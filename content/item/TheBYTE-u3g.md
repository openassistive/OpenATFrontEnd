The BYTE is an extremely affordable, safe and responsive hands free interface. 

Since it is controlled with the mouth even those with profound mobility limitations will benefit from this intuitive and accurate pointing solution.

In addition to the obvious computer use cases, I can envision applications including wheelchair or vehicular navigation, prosthetic controls, smart home controls, robotic arms...
Who knows what else - maybe this is the ideal interface for people who hang glide?
