description: "AutoIt v3 is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.  It uses a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages (e.g. VBScript and SendKeys).  AutoIt is also very small, self-contained and will run on 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP, 2003 out of the box with no annoying \"\"runtimes\"\" required!  You can even make compiled executable scripts that can run without AutoIt being installed!"

What the authors say:  

------------------------

AutoIt was initially designed for PC ""roll out"" situations to reliably configure thousands of PCs, but with the arrival of v3 it has become a powerful language able to cope with most scripting needs.

AutoIt can:

- Provide a general-purpose scripting language for all Windows versions
- Simulate keystrokes (supports most keyboard layouts)
- Simulate mouse movements and clicks
- Move, resize and manipulate windows
- Interact directly with ""controls"" on a window (set/get text from edit controls, check boxes and radio buttons, select items in drop-down lists, etc.)
- Create complex user interfaces (GUIs)
- Work with the clipboard to cut/paste text items
- Provide a scriptable RunAs function for Windows 2000/XP/2003

Unlike AutoIt2, the new AutoIt v3 language has a much more standard syntax -similar to VBScript and BASIC - and now supports complex expressions, user functions, looping and everything else that veteran scripters would expect.

As with previous versions, AutoIt has been designed to be as small as possible (~115KB) and stand-alone with no external .dll files or registry entries required.  Scripts can also be compiled into _stand-alone executables_ with **Aut2Exe**.

There will also be updates to the ActiveX and DLL versions of AutoIt called **AutoItX** - unlike v2 this will be a _combined control_ (COM and standard DLL functions in the same DLL).  AutoItX will allow you to add the unique features of AutoIt to your own favourite scripting or programming languages!

Best of all, AutoIt continues to be **FREE** - but if you want to support the time, money and effort spent on the project and web hosting then you may donate using the link to your left in the menu.

OATS Comments:
--------------

AutoIt very powerful scripting software - it will allow you to automate a great number of tasks.  For most end users there will probably be easier to use macro programs, (such as <a _self="" autohotkey="" href="" resolveuid="" target="" title="">AutoHotKey</a>)  however for some people who want the 'ultimate power' in scripting, this might be appropriate.
