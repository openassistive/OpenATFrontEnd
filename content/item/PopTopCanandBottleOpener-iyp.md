# Summary

<div>

Individuals with limited dexterity due either to problems with muscle control or to joint pain can have difficulty opening pop-top cans and opening small bottles.  This assistive device makes it easier to accomplish both tasks.

The device is comprised of two parts:

1) The pop-top can opener has a wedge at one end, a recessed slot to grasp the pop-top, and a rounded bottom to provide leverage to tear off the can top.  It should be printed in a hard plastic like PLA, ABS, or PETG.

2)The bottle opener is mounted inside the larger opening of the pop-top can opener.  It is designed to grip the sides of a bottle top and should be printed out of a flexible plastic like TPU (e.g., Ninjaflex, Polyflex).  If you are unable or reluctant to print with flexible filaments, you can use the pop-top opener without inserting this part.
