description: "Interested in keeping up with the headlines and newspapers? A new technology called RSS has recently taken the Internet by storm. Websites provide \"\"feeds\"\" of their latest stories and headlines, and you can get these simple lists, updated every few minutes.  Accessible RSS is an accessible application that lets you access these RSS feeds.  NOTE: Accessible RSS is now included in the WebbIE3 installation."

From the authors:
-----------------

**Accessible RSS** is an accessible application that lets you access these RSS feeds. It displays the headlines from web pages that support RSS. At present four sites (the BBC, the Daily Mail, the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph) are supported, but you can add your own if you find a site with an RSS feed. If you have WebbIE you can press return on a story to launch WebbIE with that story page, but you do not need WebbIE to read the feeds. If you do not have WebbIE the story will be shown in Internet Explorer

- <a accessiblerss="" and="" for="" href="" installer="" title="" webbie="">WebbIE 3 Installer</a> - includes the latest Accessible RSS News Reader.

You are likely to find that some feeds don't work: this may be because the feed is not valid. You can check the feed's validity at the <a href="">Feed Validator service</a>.
