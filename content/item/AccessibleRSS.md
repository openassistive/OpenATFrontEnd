Interested in keeping up with the headlines and newspapers? An Internet system called RSS or Atom lets you do it easily. Websites provide "feeds" of their latest stories and headlines, and you can get these simple lists, updated every few minutes. If you want to know more about a story you can go straight to its webpage on its website and read it. No navigating difficult website and trying to spot what's changed!
