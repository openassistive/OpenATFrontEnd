Using a simple template matching technique, this Processing-based app makes it possible to type text using blinks only. The app distinguishes 3 types of eye patterns that are registered at initialization: normal, action, extra-action (corresponding, typically, to a normal eye gaze, eye rolled-up, and eye shut). Currently only two gestures are used.

The user is prompted aurally with the row number (row of letters) and, on blink ("action" pattern), then individual letters within that row.
