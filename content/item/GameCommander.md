What the authors say:  

------------------------

Game Commander is a voice control application for games. Many of today's games have a lot of keyboard commands that can be hard to remember. Game Commander takes you to the next level of gaming by enabling you to control most Windows<sup>®</sup> 98/Me/2000/XP games with verbal commands instead of or in tandem with keyboard, joystick, and mouse controls. For example, instead of remembering that Alt+Shift+F8 is the command for lock missiles, you can just say ""Lock Missiles.""

OATS Comments:
--------------

Most of the versions of this software are commerical, however the free trial listed here is actually quite useful!  It is not time limited, but limits the number of keystrokes sent per command to one and the number of commands in a list to 5.  This might be OK for some people!
