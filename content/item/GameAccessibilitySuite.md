The Game Accessibility Suite [GAS] is a collection of utilities built to make video games more accessible. The current focus is the Win32 platform (esp. Windows XP).Â  It is released under an MIT-style license.

  
Currently, there are a handful of utilities being developed alongside a core library including:

- GASCap, a utility for in-game closed-captioning of DirectX-based video games.
- GASPedal, an in-game utility for switch control of DirectX games.
- GASThrottle, a utility to control the speed of modern games.

  
Currently, only GASThrottle is far enough along for a released (functional) prototype.
