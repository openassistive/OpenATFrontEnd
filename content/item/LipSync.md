The &quot;LipSync&quot; is an assistive technology device which is being developed to allow quadriplegics and other people with limited hand use the ability to use touchscreen mobile devices by manipulation of a mouth-operated joystick with integrated sip and puff controls. The user is able to manipulate a cursor on their device screen using a mouth-operated joystick with integrated sip and puff controls to simulate the actions of &quot;tap&quot; and hitting the back button, respectively. With longer sips and longer puffs, additional secondary features are enabled including a &quot;tap and drag&quot;, &quot;long tap and drag&quot; and the possibility of more specialized functions as per the user's needs. The LipSync is design specifically for portable devices, it does not require AC power, but it will work with any device including desktop and laptop computers that support mice through a universal serial bus (USB).
