title: "Accessible BBC Listen Again"
date: "2016-06-21"
description: "The British Broadcast Company (BBC) allows people to listen to vast quantities of their radio output up to a week after it is first broadcast on one of their dozens of radio stations. This service, called Listen Again, relies on a web browser interface that might be difficult for some users, especially people with screen readers. Accessible BBC Listen Again allows you to access the BBC\'s Listen Again content through a truly accessible interface designed to work with any screen reader."

From the authors:
-----------------

Select programmes and stations with the cursor keys and listen to them at your leisure. You get easy and simple access to hours of programming, including the ever-popular ""The Archers"" and ""In Touch"".

The new version (2.1) lets you access all of the Listen Again content among many other improvements (thanks to everyone for their suggestions!) It does still require that you have already installed <a bbc="" href="" of="" realplayer="" title="" version="">RealPlayer from Real</a>. The copyright of the BBC recordings is unchanged: you are simply accessing them through a more accessible presentation of their own website. Version 2.1 should work better on more machines: several users contacted me with problems with 2.0
