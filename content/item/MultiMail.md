description: "MultiMail is an electronic mail (email) program that includes word prediction and gives you a range of interface and user options. MultiMail should improve email communication opportunities for Internet users with a disability. MultiMail was originally designed for Windows 3.x/95 so that consumers with older computer equipment could use this free product. A 32- bit version for Windows 95/98/2000 has now been implemented.
