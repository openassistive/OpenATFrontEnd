Also, RapidKeys has user-defined autoexpandable abbreviations. The user can define short sequences of characters that will be replaced with long sequences of characters when they are typed.

A similar mechanism is used for names. The user can define names and after this he can write them with lower letters, the names being automatically transformed to the proper form.

Other mechanisms are also used to minimize the number of clicks. An optional AutoCaps mechanism detects the end of sentences and temporarily switches for one capital letter. Buttons can be right-clicked for the alternative meaning.

RapidKeys is resizable. It is free for personal use (in a non-commercial enviroment). If you need to use it in a commercial enviroment, if you need technical support or if you need additional features (custom keyboard layouts, custom commands and so on), then contact the author.
