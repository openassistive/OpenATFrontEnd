This project contains a set of template web pages and associated resources that provide simple low-clutter presentations, and offer easy tab-enter keyboard navigation as well as text-to-speech support. These pages are accessible to a wide range of users without additional modifications. The templates have a built-in editing tool that makes customization and creation of new pages easier for non-technical users. The set includes pages for creating tables of contents, simple story pages,  picture grids, simple 2 and 4 button communications pages, and a YouTube viewer. How-to materials are also included in the release.

You can see how these pages work by visiting: https://jamjolu.neocities.org/
The pages at the neocities site are not all up-to-date.
