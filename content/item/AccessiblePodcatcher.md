Accessible Podcatcher (formerly Accessible Podcaster) is a simple way for blind and screen reader users to use podcasts. Podcasting is a way to distribute audio files on the web. Accessible Podcatcher lets you access these podcasts. You can listen to them, forward and rewind, save particular items to disk, and export and import lists of podcasts to send to other people. You also get Accessible Podcast Directory, a way for you to find new podcasts to add to your collection.
