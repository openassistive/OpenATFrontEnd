What the authors say:  

------------------------

1. To make the Web easier to access for print-disabled users (such as users with low vision or dyslexia);
2. To allow speakers of other languages to view Web pages written in them, when the encodings are not supported by their browsers.  (This uses GIFs - see <a href="">GIF Patent Problems and the Language Viewer</a>)

The gateway works by intercepting your Web browsing in such a way that the gateway computer can sort out the Web pages before you see them.  It works with all browsers and operating systems as long as the browser supports forms <a footnote2="" name=""></a><a href="">[1]</a>.  You can adjust it to work the way you want to.

If you need an academic paper about the gateway, try this:

 The gateway can also (sometimes) be used as a rudimentary viewer of such things as Flash and WAP, if you have no other means of displaying them.  In the case of WAP, the intention is that print-disabled users can use WAP sites on their normal desktop browsers.
