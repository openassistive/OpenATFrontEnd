title: "Gaze Talk"
date: "2016-06-21"
description: "GazeTalk is a predictive text entry system that has a restricted on-screen keyboard with ambiguous layout for severely disabled people. The main reason for using such a keyboard layout is that it enables the use of an eye tracker with a low spatial resolution (e.g., a web-camera based eye tracker)."

From the Authors:
-----------------

The goal of the GazeTalk project is to develop an eye-tracking based ACC system that supports several languages, facilitates fast text entry, and is both sufficiently feature-complete to be deployed as the primary AAC tool for users, yet sufficiently flexible and technically advanced to be used for research purposes. The system is designed for several target languages, initially Danish, English, Italian, German and Japanese.

**Main features:**

- type-to-talk
- writing
- email
- web – browser
- Multimedia – player
- PDF – reader
- letter and word prediction, and word completion
- speech output
- can be operated by gaze, headtracking, mouse, joystick, or any other pointing device
- supports step-scanning (new!)
- supports users with low precision in their movements, or trackers with low accuracy
- allows the user to use Dasher inside GazeTalk and to transfer the text written in Dasher back to GazeTalk

 GazeTalk 5.0 has been designed and developed by the <a href="">Eye Gaze Interaction Group</a> at the <a href="">IT University of Copenhagen</a> and the IT-Lab at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, Copenhagen.

  
OATS Comment
------------

This may also be a useful predictive communication system for literate people who use a mouse to access the computer (as well as eye-gaze).
