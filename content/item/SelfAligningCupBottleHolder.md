Self aligning cup/bottle holder for use with crutches, walkers and wheelchairs. Taking advantage of the gyroscopic effect and gravity this cup/bottle holder keeps it's contents always aligned. Unfortunately many of the people that have limited use of their hands and fingers, and have to simultaneously use crutches, walkers or wheelchairs have trouble carrying bottles and cups in particular, usually they depend on others to given them a helping hand, others have attachments that allow them to carry these objects but most of the times these only allow for cans or closed bottles, for reason I designed this gyroscopic cup holder, due to it's design it will ensure that your drink is always correctly orientated and you can concentrate on moving to where you need to be.

This design contains several versions of many parts to accommodate different placements, tube sizes cup/bottles sizes, it should be ideal for most uses but if you require a specific size for any of the parts (tube clip and clip supports) let know and I will what I can do for you.
