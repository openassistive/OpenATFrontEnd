From the Authors:
-----------------

  
NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) is a free “screen reader” which enables blind and vision impaired people to use computers. It reads the text on the screen in a computerised voice. You can control what is read to you by moving the cursor to the relevant area of text with a mouse or the arrows on your keyboard.

NVDA can also convert the text into braille if the computer user owns a device called a “braille display”.

NVDA provides the key to education and employment for many blind people. It also provides access to social networking, online shopping, banking and news.

<a href="">NVDA</a> works with Microsoft Windows. You can <a href="">download</a> it to your PC, or to a USB stick which you can use with any computer.

Normally screen readers are expensive, making them unaffordable for many blind people. NVDA is free. It’s been downloaded 70,000+ times, in 43 languages.

  
<div class="" column="">Here is a snapshot of just some of NVDA’s features.

- Support for popular applications including web browsers, email, internet chatting, and office programs including Word and Excel.
