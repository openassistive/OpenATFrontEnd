From the authors:
-----------------

AAC Keys is a keyboard and mouse emulation program for Microsoft Windows-based and **Macintosh** computers.

AAC Keys receives commands through your computer's serial port and translates them into keystrokes and mouse moves, giving you full control of your computer from another device. AAC Keys implements the common <a href="">**GIDEI**</a> (General Input Device Emulating Interface) commands (see below).

AAC Keys has been designed to work with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4, and Windows 2000 operating systems.

A Macintosh version was developed following the introduction of OS X . (Earlier Macintosh operating systems included SerialKeys.) The Macintosh version was developed by computer science students at **<a href="">Millersville University of Pennsylvania</a>** under the supervision of <a href="">**Dr. Blaise Liffick**</a>.
