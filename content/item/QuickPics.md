QuickPics is a easy to use software application to develop communication and language boards. The program allows design and development of communication boards with visual graphics using an interface that is similar to a word processing program. Graphics are included in the program and are searchable by keyword. The storybook graphics are colorful and engaging.

The downloaded program includes 350 graphics; however, it can be easily expanded with additional picture libraries. Users of this program can modify the graphics and submit them.  Submitted copyright-free graphics will be compiled with keywords and added to the bank of picture libraries. The additional picture libraries will be offered to the QuickPics community and can be installed into the original QuickPics program.
