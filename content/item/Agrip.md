From the Authors:
-----------------

  
Over the past two years, AGRIP has developed an accessible version of Quake and <a href="" quakeworld="">QuakeWorld</a> which allows both single and multi-player games, including the collection of online player statistics. In the future we will add immersive 3D audio and level editing facilities - in addition to the gameplay modifications that are currently possible. At each milestone in the project, we make public releases of our software.

This page explains the history of the project and the technology involved in more detail.

About the AGRIP Project
-----------------------

Accessible Gaming Rendering Independence Possible (you can see why we shorten it to ""AGRIP""!) was started in May 2003 with the goal of making a mainstream first-person shooter game for the sighted accessible. It was founded by <a href="" matthewatkinson="">MatthewAtkinson</a> and <a href="" sabahattingucukoglu="">SabahattinGucukoglu</a>. This section provides all sorts of information about the project. It is split into the following sections:

- <a href="" projectinfosection="">/ProjectRationale</a> - all about what we're doing and why we're doing it.
- <a href="" projectinfosection="">/TheRoadmap</a> - our plans for development - posted here so you can contact us with suggestions on how to improve them.
- <a href="" projectinfosection="">/TheLogo</a> - description and explanation of the logo, plus an audio version of it.
- <a href="" projectinfosection="">/OnlineShop</a> - information on how to show your support for the project, by wearing an AGRIP T-Shirt.
