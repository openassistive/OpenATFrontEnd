Toetsenbordhulp is a project aimed at helping people who have a hard time controlling their motor movement while typing.In more particular it was designed for Kurt who had a oxygen deficiency while he was born, paralyzing some parts of his brain. This lowered his motor skills, making it more difficult for him to type. To learn more about our project you can follow us on our [blog](http://toetsenbordhulp2014.blogspot.be/) or watch this [video](http://youtu.be/7rUNolTb-Fw).
