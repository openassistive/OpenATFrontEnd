# Summary

<div>

Utensil holders give people with limited grip, hand strength, or dexterity a way to use items like eating utensils, toothbrushes, writing tools, and other small items. This device is focused on support for eating but the design could be extended easily to other objects. It was inspired by a post to the ATMakers.org page on Facebook asking for a utensil holder that accommodated knifes as well as forks and spoons. This design has several advantages over other designs:

*   It is 3D printable for just pennies using the most commonly used filament - PLA.
*   Separates the device into a hand mount and a utensil mount. Each can be separately sized to accommodate differently sized hands and differently sized utensils.
*   The two components are joined using a common interface that can be extended for use with other objects like a pen holder or a hairbrush holder.
*   The utensil mount comes in two orientations to support both forks/spoons and knives.
*   The utensil mount attaches below the hand for a natural orientation.
*   The hand mount incorporates a thumb rest/guard to protect the thumb from being injured by the utensil or dragged through the food.

While a few STL files have been included for visualization you will actually want to download the file called UtensilHolderSTLFiles.zip. That file contains a wide variety of mount and fixture sizes. You will also want to go to this web page ([https://wp.me/P9evBA-3n](https://wp.me/P9evBA-3n)) to learn how to choose a set of files and how to assemble the components.

**Notes:**

You may need to apply something like glue stick or hairspray in order to get the thinner items like small hand mounts to adhere to the print bed. Don't use a brim if you can avoid it, especially on the hand mount component . They are difficult to remove and can be an irritant for the user.
