The Interact Switch is a high-quality adaptive switch designed to meet and exceed the performance of commercial switches. You can read more about its development here:
https://hackaday.io/projects/hacker/83144

Detailed build instructions can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uWRKXmApZUaSo1I0oyyFrAfncziYsd2_8ai8dunogJs/edit?usp=sharing

For assembly, you will need a ButtonCapBase, ButtonCapHolder, ButtonCapInsert, and a ButtonCap. Note that there are multiple versions of the ButtonCapInsert. This allows you to tune the switch for proper/ best operation. I recommend starting with the 0.6mm insert and adjusting as necessary.

For each switch you wish to build, you will also need:

1 Omron SS-3GP microswitch
(check Octopart for sourcing https://octopart.com/search?q=ss-3gp )
A cable with a 3.5mm mono plug on the end. Six ft. is a good standard length for a switch.
(something like https://www.cnaweb.com/6-ft-3-5mm-mono-patch-cable.aspx )
I've also really liked these cables, and would especially recommend them if you're making a large number of switches: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32932910517.html
3 M2.5x10 pan head screws (any length from 8-12mm is fine.)
