When the button is pressed and held, the lights in an LED array will turn on one by one until the user releases the button on their selection. The loop is then paused awaiting input from the user. If the button is not pressed within approximately 5 seconds, the program resets. If the button is pressed and held, the mouse will either move in the direction selected or perform mouse clicks (left, right, or double click).
