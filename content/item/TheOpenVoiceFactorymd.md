The Open Voice Factory converts communication boards into communication devices.

Anyone can create an aid by editing a PowerPoint template to add their one pages or utterances. When you upload your template to the factory, it will create a working communication aid for you.

The resulting programs run on any platform, from tablets to laptops to phones, without installation or complex setup.
