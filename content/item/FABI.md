## How?

The FABI Interface can be actuated via dedicated buttons, momentary switches or self-made electrical contacts. FABI consists of a hardware module (a low-cost microcontroller which behaves as a computer mouse and/or keyboard) and a graphical software application for configuration of the desired functions.

## Where should I start?

This user manual includes a “do-it-yourself” building guide for your personal FABI device, describing the necessary hardware components and the Graphical User Interface application for the configuration of the different functions. A configured FABI module can be used on any computer (Windows, Linux or Mac) without installation of special software, because the FABI module behaves exactly like a standard mouse and keyboard which is plugged into your computer.

Nevertheless, for configuring the desired functions via the GUI application a driver installation is necessary. The driver installation is also explained in the software section of this manual. FABI is an open source Assistive Technology module developed by the AsTeRICS Academy Project of the University of Applied Sciences, Technikum Wien (see http://www.asterics-academy.net).

All software and hardware documents are open source and we took care to use the most affordable components available on the market to establish these functionalities – making FABI the most reasonably priced flexible assistive button interface we know !!
