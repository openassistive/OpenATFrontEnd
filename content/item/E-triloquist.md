description: "The program has an input area on the screen for entering a text or audio phrase which is to be spoken or played. With the touch of the \"Enter\" key or a mouse click, the text is converted to speech and sent to a voice synthesizer which conveys the message in mellifluous tones.

### From the Authors:

E-triloquist, the personal computer augmentative communication aid software formerly known as ""SpeakEasy"", developed as a family project. Dad had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and lost his ability to speak in the course of the disease. Son is particularly versatile in personal computers. Our first version (named ""SpeakEasy"" at the time) was made available on the Internet in early 1995. We are now on Version 5.7 with even more new features suggested by current users of the program, and with full support for Windows-ME and Windows-XP operating systems. See the <a href="">New Features</a> page for full details on the enhancements in V5.7. Go to the <a href="">Downloads</a> page to install or upgrade to the latest version of E-triloquist.

 Most users of the program can still use a keyboard, albeit slowly. For those who can no longer type, E-triloquist can easily be teamed-up with on-screen keyboards, scanners, word-predictors, single-switch input, or other assistive input devices such as <a href="">Click-N-Type virtual keyboard</a> from Lake Software, <a href="">SofType</a> from <a href="">Origin Instruments</a>, <a href="">WiViK®</a> on-screen keyboard (virtual keyboard) software, <a href="">Virtual On-Screen Keyboard</a> by <a href="">MiloSoft</a>, <a href="">My-T-Mouse</a> from <a href="">IMG</a>, and a variety of input devices and augmentative communication products from <a href="">Prentke Romich Company</a>. A longer list of devices can be viewed on the <a href="">ALS Resources</a> page. These tools can also be added on at a later time if the need arises. Note: when looking for assistive input devices, be sure to get one that will work with ALL of your Windows programs, (e.g. E-triloquist, word processor, e-mail, web browser, ...) not just one specific software program.
