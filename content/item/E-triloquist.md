The E-triloquist program has an input area on the screen for entering a text or audio phrase which is to be spoken or played. With the touch of the ""Enter"" key or a mouse click, the text is converted to speech and sent to a voice synthesizer which conveys the message in mellifluous tones. Audio phrases are played as recorded.

Most users of the program can still use a keyboard, albeit slowly. For those who can no longer type, E-triloquist can easily be teamed-up with on-screen keyboards, scanners, word-predictors, single-switch input, or other assistive input devices such as <a href="">Click-N-Type virtual keyboard</a> from Lake Software, <a href="">SofType</a> from <a href="">Origin Instruments</a>, <a href="">WiViKÂ®</a> on-screen keyboard (virtual keyboard) software, <a href="">Virtual On-Screen Keyboard</a> by <a href="">MiloSoft</a>, <a href="">My-T-Mouse</a> from <a href="">IMG</a>, and a variety of input devices and augmentative communication products from <a href="">Prentke Romich Company</a>. A longer list of devices can be viewed on the <a href="">ALS Resources</a> page. These tools can also be added on at a later time if the need arises. Note: when looking for assistive input devices, be sure to get one that will work with ALL of your Windows programs, (e.g. E-triloquist, word processor, e-mail, web browser, ...) not just one specific software program.
