From the author:  

-------------------

  
RemoteKeys can automate complex control systems, but also simple jobs like inserting text passages into Word and EMails, filling out (internet-) forms with recurring phrases etc. To do this simply click onto one of the 2500 buttons, which can be freely assigned and labelled. The macros can also be released by using the keyboard if prefered.

  
For those wishing to make full use of RemoteKeys, there are over 350 commands available, e.g. inserting the actual date into a text, opening program groups and ordering them on screen or even to automize Excel calculations. The buttons may be assigned with the help of the integrated macro recorder and an integrated timer can activate these buttons.

  
Additional features include an image memory and a clipboard history function. RemoteKeys is always at hand in the systemtray, can be individually configured (button-, form-, fontsizes and -colours), is network - able and requires no installation. (Engl./Ger./French with manuals)..

OATS Comments:  

-----------------

RemoteKeys looks potentially quite powerful, and possibly includes and on-screen-keyboard. It has not been tested by a member of the OATS team yet though.Â  It may be quite hard to install for novices.
