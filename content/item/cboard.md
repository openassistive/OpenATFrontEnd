[Cboard](https://www.cboard.io/) is an open-source AAC communication board for the web, it helps users with speech and language impairments (autism, cerebral palsy) to communicate via symbols and text-to-speech.
It uses the browser's Speech Synthesis API to generate speech when a symbol is clicked, there are [3400 symbols](https://github.com/straight-street/mulberry-symbols) to choose from when customizing boards.

Cboard is available in 33 languages (availability varies by OS and browser).

Works offline in browsers that support Service Worker API (board customization may still require an internet connection).

Platforms: mobile, desktop.
