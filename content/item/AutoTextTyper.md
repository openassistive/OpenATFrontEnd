AutoTextTyper is a contextual menu plugin that lets you quickly and easily add commonly used text, such as email addresses, web sites, postal addresses, company names, form letters, and more, to a list of items in a contextual menu. You can also have the current date and/or time typed. You can then select any of those items from the menu and have them automatically typed into any application that supports contextual menus. You can also associate a key combination (a Hot Key) with a macro and use that Hot Key to invoke the macro.
