You must have Microsoft Reader installed on your machine before the Microsoft Reader Text-to-Speech Package can be installed. The Text-to-Speech Package is available in English, French and German.

OATS Comment:
-------------

This can be great for people who want to either:

- Read books but can't turn pages (use in conjunction with a switch-input program)
- Read books but struggle to see the text
- Need some support in reading text (e.g. highlighting)
