The Web Page Communicator package - including formEdit

The screenshot above shows a typical communication page assembled using formEdit and a template from the Web Page Communicator package. This page supports multiple access methods including direct selection (point and click), single switch scanning (auto scan) and two switch scanning (step scanning.) It also has a random selection method useful as a spinner for games. It supports auditory scanning as well.

These pages and the resource files for the page's pictures and sounds should be stored on the device being used rather than on the Internet to achieve acceptable performance. However, the pages, the resource files and formEdit are all portable, and work fine off of CD-ROM disks, or flash memory devices. So, you could carry a complete communications system in your flash drive. plug it into any computer, open your pages with almost any browser, and you are ready to communicate!

formEdit, a Windows 95+ compatable program, makes it easy to to edit picture grids, assign sounds to cells for both messages and auditory scan cues, and define links to other communications pages, or anywhere your browser can go. Currently, the templates include 1X4, 2X3, 2X4, 3X4, 4X5, and 4X6 grids for basic communicators. In the future, I hope to add more advanced features for the more sophisitcated communicator.
