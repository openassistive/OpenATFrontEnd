Unlike the flagship product, CHIPSpeaking™ , CHIPSpeech™  actually is written to assist PALS to record their voice as it is now, and preserve the phrases and sentences that are needed in everyday life, and recall them in their own voice, and save that speech indefinitely. The recordings are made and saved to disk in small files, which can be saved on diskette or backup media for use on other computers.
