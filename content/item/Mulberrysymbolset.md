This is a fully funded project to develop the Mulberry Symbol Set.  It will be free of cost to everyone and distributed with a Creative Commons BY-SA license (essentially making these images ""open source"" - that is, the user will be free to copy, distribute or amend these images as they see fit). You will be able to use them with any software that supports .wmf format. This includes, with permission, commercial products.

A team of people are now producing symbols with 2500 now available with a further 1000 in production. 

Prior to publishing each new batch of symbols, they are reviewed by a team of professionals (such as speech and language therapists, teachers and classroom assistants and representatives from suppliers of AAC devices).
