JoyToKey is a keyboard and mouse emulator for joysticks. It converts joystick input into keyboard input (and mouse input). Use it when you want to control an application with joysticks that doesn't support joystick input. If you wish, you can control even Word, Excel, etc. with joysticks!

It is also a way for accessibility switch users to access PCs when using a switch adapted game controller. These can be bought or built following DIY guides.
