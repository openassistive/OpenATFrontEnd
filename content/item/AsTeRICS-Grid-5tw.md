Simple to use, offline web communication grid (AAC), integrated with [AsTeRICS](https://www.asterics.eu/)

App for creating a flexible grid system that can be used for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), Environmental control or interaction with custom ARE models. The AsTeRICS Grid will also be runnable standalone, without any AsTeRICS backend.

See https://grid.asterics.eu/ for a online demo of the Grid, see https://grid.asterics.eu/latest/ for testing the latest (but maybe unstable) version.

The AsTeRICS Grid evolved out of AsTeRICS Ergo, see [AsTeRICS Ergo Master Plan](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Ergo/wiki/Master-Plan-AsTeRICS-Ergo) and [AsTeRICS Ergo Architecture](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Ergo/wiki/Architecture) and will eventually replace AsTeRICS Ergo.
