Record your voice and hear it played back while a face animates! Whilst this has been done before in other contexts, we have made this stand-alone program freely available. You can choose from seven faces:

- Alien
 -Female
- Male
- Robot
- Simple
- Clown
- Santa Claus

You can use one or two switch scanning, mouse or touchscreen and keyboard shortcuts. The sound file can be saved to disc.
