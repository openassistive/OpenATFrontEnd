SAW - Special Access to Windows - is a programmable on-screen keyboard.
It is a powerful tool for providing Access to the Windows operating system
for people who need alternative Switch or Pointing device input options.
\nThe new SAW 6 version - supported by the AEGIS project
([http://www.aegis-project.eu/](http://www.aegis-project.eu/)) - is now
available. It is fully Windows 7-10 compatible, supports Unicode,
includes its own \"Blade\" word prediction and abbreviation expansion engine,
can interact with the CCF-SymbolServer for graphic symbol support
([http://conceptcoding.org/](http://conceptcoding.org/)), and adds several
other feautures to make creating interfaces easy for those who use alternative
inputs.
