While the look and feel of an application is determined by many individual components, some organization is necessary in order to unify the appearance and structure of individual icon sets used within those components.

The Tango Desktop Project defines an <a guidelines="" href="" icon="" tango="" theme="" title="">icon style guideline</a> to which artists and designers can adhere. Work has begun with the creation of a new <a href="" icon="" library="" tango="" title="">icon theme</a> based upon a standardized <a href="" icon="" naming="" specification="" standard="" title="">icon naming specification</a>. In addition, the project provides transitional utilities to assist in creating icon themes for existing desktop environments, such as <a class="" external="" href="" http:="" nofollow="" rel="" text="" title="">GNOME</a> and <a class="" external="" href="" http:="" nofollow="" rel="" text="" title="">KDE</a>.

  
Eventually, the Tango Desktop Project will provide the following initiatives:

- A suggested default native look.
- A subsystem to help standardize toolkits on a common icon naming structure.
- A complete set of application, mimetype, and stock <a href="" icon="" library="" tango="" title="">icons</a> designed using a defined <a guidelines="" href="" icon="" tango="" theme="" title="">style guide</a>.
- A general, cross-desktop human interface guideline
