description: "ICUTalk was a research project, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) from 1999 to 2002. The project developed an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system to help patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) who are temporarily unable to speak due to their medical condition or treatment, namely the intubation procedure. This was a multi-disciplinary collaborative project involving staff from the University of Dundee (School of Computing and the School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery)  and Ninewells Hospital, Dundee (Speech &amp; Language Therapy and Intensive Care Unit). Andy Judson was the software developer and Professor Ian Ricketts was the principal investigator."
