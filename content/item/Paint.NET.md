##### **About**  
Paint.NET is free image and <a _top="" class="" href="" id="" klink="" konalink0="" target="">photo editing software</a> for computers that run Windows. It <a href="">features</a> an intuitive and innovative user interface with support for layers, unlimited undo, special effects, and a wide variety of useful and powerful tools. An active and growing <a href="">online community</a> provides friendly help, <a href="">tutorials</a>, and <a href="">plugins</a>.

##### It started development as an undergraduate college senior design project mentored by Microsoft, and is currently being maintained by some of the alumni that originally worked on it. Originally intended as a free replacement for the <a _blank="" href="" target="">Microsoft Paint</a> software that comes with Windows, it has grown into a powerful yet simple image and photo editor tool. It has been compared to other digital photo editing software packages such as <a _blank="" href="" target="">Adobe<sup>速</sup> Photoshop<sup>速</sup></a>, Corel<sup>速</sup><a _blank="" href="" target="">Paint Shop Pro<sup>速</sup></a>, Microsoft Photo Editor, and <a _blank="" href="" target="">The GIMP</a>.

##### The programming language used to create Paint.NET is C#, with a small amount of C++ for installation and shell-integration related functionality. The <a href="">source code</a> is available under the terms of the <a _blank="" href="" target="">MIT License</a>.
