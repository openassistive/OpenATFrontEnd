Free Speech for Android is a free and open source sound board for people who have problems speaking. When you press a button, a sound is played.   
  
You can use recorded sounds, record new sounds, or generate sounds using the built-in text-to-speech. All content can be created and edited using your Android device itself.   
  
The full source code for free speech is available at:
