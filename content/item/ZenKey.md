Using keystrokes that work no matter what program you are in, you can do actions like launch a program or bring it back into focus; open a document, folder or Internet resource; perform an Internet search; minimize or maximize a window; issue a Media command. You can add any program, add or alter any menu, and assign any keystroke to perform any action.

Although not as powerfull as AutoHotkey its menu and wizard driven interface makes it simpler to use for those not into programming and scripting based systems.
