Using keystrokes that work no matter what program you are in, you can do actions like launch a program or bring it back into focus; open a document, folder or Internet resource; perform an Internet search; minimize or maximize a window; issue a Media command. You can add any program, add or alter any menu, and assign any keystroke to perform any action.

Although not as powerfull as AutoHotkey its menu and wizard driven interface makes it simpler to use for those not into programming and scripting based systems.

**From the Web Site**

Zenkey is comprised of a series of menus, each item of which performs an ""action"". You can ""fire"" these actions by clicking on the item, or pressing any key-combination you choose. Using these actions, you can:

**Open a program or file** These actions launch a program or open a document (with its associated application). If you launch a a program that is already running, you can choose whether this program should be brought to the foreground, or whether ZenKEY should launch a new instance of it. You can also choose to launch programs automatically on ZenKEY startup.  
 **Open a Control panel applet** Directly open an item which appears in your control panel   
 **Issue a Media command** Send a special 'Windows Media' command to the computer. These can be used to play, pause or stop compatible Media players, change the system volume, bass or treble, or even open default web browsers and e-mail clients.   
 **Open a folder** Open a folder in Windows explorer   
 **Open an Internet location** Open an Internet resource, either a website (http://), a secure website (https://) or an FTP site (File Transfer Protocol).  
 **Perform an Internet Search**  
Perform an Internet search almost any Search Engine  
 **Issue a Windows System commands**  
Perform operating system functions, such as shutting down your computer, starting the screen saver or altering the mouse pointer speed..   
 **Control Winamp** From playing or pausing to changing volume, these commands allow you to comprehensively control the Winamp media player (or compatibles, such as QCD Player and STP)  
 **Control program Windows** These commands can be used to reposition program windows, to change their properties, to alter their transparency (XP and 2000 only) or even to send them to the system tray. You can tell ZenKEY whether you want the action to be performed on the currently active window (default), or whichever window is lying under the mouse cursor.   
**Perform ZenKEY actions** These actions control ZenKEY and change its' behavior.  
 **Open ZenKEY group**s  
Opens any ZenKEY menu containing any other groups or actions.  
**Simulate a series of keystrokes**  
Emulate a series of keystrokes, and thus automate the typing of repetative text or the entering of passwords.
