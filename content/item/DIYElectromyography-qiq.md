Electromyography (EMG) is the measurement of nerve impulses to your muscles. Probably the most popular consumer device using EMG is the Myo, which is an armband that lets you do gesture controlâ€“ check out their website to see some cool demos of why EMG is exciting.

The principle behind EMG is pretty simple: nerve impulses are electrical signals on the order of millivolts, and you can read those millivolts through your skin using electrodes.

In this Instructable, I'll show you how to read the muscle impulses in your bicep, using materials you can buy online and a bit of simple JavaScript code.
