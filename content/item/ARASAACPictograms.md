From the authors:
-----------------

The ARASAAC portal offers graphic resources and materials to facilitate communication for those with some sort of problem in this area.

OATSoft comment:  

-------------------

This is an increasingly popular and widely used AAC resource, and the symbol file libraries are available with the file names translated into a growing number of languages. The file format provided is 500 pixels high PNG. Though the number of files is quite large, there is a fair amount of redundancy due to numerous duplication of symbols labelled with different names.
