**From the Authors**

The World-Wide Augmentative and Alternative Communication (WWAAC) project is an EU initiative to make web and email-based technology more accessible to people with communication, language and/or cognitive impairment and who use symbol systems.

The World-Wide Augmentative and Alternative Communication (WWAAC) project is a pan-European initiative to make web and email-based technology more accessible to people with communication, language and/or cognitive impairment and who use symbol systems.

In the context of these users the project addresses the development and early implementation of the following:

- Preliminary guidelines for syntax and semantic concept/text/message encoding.
- Tools for text support - ie message conversion between symbols and symbols and symbols & text, with speech output.
- Tools for task support - for web browsing and mail box handling.
- Guidelines and tools for information presentation on the web for the target users.

Involvement of end users, state-of-the-art developers, and researchers should lead to commercially attractive and close-to-the-market products. A Code of Practice for webmasters and websites interested in symbol users will be drawn up, which, it is hoped, will be included in international standards.
