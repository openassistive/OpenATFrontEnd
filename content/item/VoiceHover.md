VOICE[H]OVER works much like the head mounted laser and print out, but is notably different because of its ability to export inputs into a .txt file that can be read by a Python code that will speak with natural language. When used effectively, it can be used to eliminate the necessity of help from others. It is unlike other options of this technology because it is affordable and only needs a computer with a webcam.
