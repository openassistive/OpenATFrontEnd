> This instructable will go through the steps required for building a powered mobility training device for young children. The device consists of a 4 wheel platform, of which two are drive wheels controlled by a standard 9 pin direction input interface. This instructable offers two approaches to build this device. One approach uses an off the shelf baby cruizer as the platform, while the other requires a DIY platform. The second, DIY approach, is the one this instructable will focus on. Both approaches require a standard car seat for the child to use the device.
