From the author:
----------------

Eventcorder allows sequences of keystrokes and mouse-clicks (events) to be recorded, and then played back at the touch of a button. It also allows recorded sequences (known as macros) to be edited. The software matches up events with the window for which they were recorded, and will wait for the correct window to open before implementing a particular event, so that events cannot act in the wrong window.
