A database of all official Blissymbols, and their definitions. Plus some additional utilities. Contents:

- `blissdata_chars.js`, `blissdata_words.js`: this are the most important files, the database itself
- `blissviewer.js`: a generic Javascript module for attaching Blissymbols to text
  - this file is compiled from the corresponding TypeScript file `blissviewer.ts`
- `blissviewer.css`: example CSS style sheet for displaying the Blissymbols
- `blissviewer-demo.html`: a simple webpage that shows how `blissviewer.js` can be used; you can test it out here:
  - <https://blissymbolics.github.io/blissymbols/blissviewer-demo.html>
  - the demo uses a wrapper Javascript file `blissdemo.js`, and the JQuery library

There are only three global names that are introduced by the library:
`BLISS_CHAR_DATA`, `BLISS_WORD_DATA` and `BlissViewer` are defined by `blissdata_chars.js`, `blissdata_words.js`
and `blissviewer.js`, respectively. They are supposed to be used like this:

    var myBlissViewer = new BlissViewer(BLISS_CHAR_DATA, BLISS_WORD_DATA, {...})

(The third argument to the BlissViewer constructor is an optional configuration dictionary).
