Jambu is a program that provides access to the web and computer programs without a mouse or keyboard. It gives direct access for users with physical disabilities who use simple input devices with very limited gestures, for example head switches. Jambu allows switch users to navigate and operate accessible applications like Firefox 3 without using intermediate Overlay grids of buttons.

Jambu is free Open Source software for Linux with GNOME written in Python. It works with Firefox 3 to give access to the web and also works with other accessible GNOME programs.
