## To export the site to gh-pages (windows or other)

Not so straightforward.. Basically you have to build the site (to public) and then copy any changes to a checked out version of the gh-pages branch
Its what that deploy2.sh does for you automagically. 
The neatest way in the future is really to make changes directly on github and travis-ci will do the automagic for you

## Notes

* Note that the theme is Based at https://github.com/openassistive/openat-hugrid
* The hugo site is a static site generator. Its designed to be run locally and then all /public (or dist - depending on how you want to run the build) is the live static site all in html
* there is a Makefile and a .travis.yml file in this repo. This allows the site to be automagically built on a commit on travis.
